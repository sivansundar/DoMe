# DoMe
This is a minimal note taking application for Android built using Realm.

## Getting Started
This application implements a NoSQL database called Realm. Database transactions are way faster than SQLite and other alternatives. The basic functionality of the application as of now is to take down notes and tasks and delete them if needed.
